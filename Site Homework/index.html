        <p>It's a book that had a huge impact on me. I loved that as a shape for a novel; put a bunch of people in
            a beautiful place, give them all tuberculosis, make them all stay in a fur sleeping.</p>

                Once a landscape is industrialized, its wild character is lost for good. You can't recreate
                untouched tundra, mountain meadows, crystal clear streams and animals that have never encountered
                toxic waste. Mountains are the beginning of the wild life and pure nature we need.
